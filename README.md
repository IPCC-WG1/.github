PlayFab will process Game Data including personal data within the scope of the CCPA on your behalf and, not retain, use, or disclose that data for any purpose other than for the purposes set out in these Terms and as permitted under the CCPA, including under any "sale" exemption. In no event will PlayFab sell any such Game Data. These CCPA terms do not limit or reduce any data protection commitments PlayFab makes to you in these Terms or any other agreement between you and PlayFab.

4. GDPR Terms
The terms of this Section 4 (the "GDPR Terms") apply to the extent your Game Data includes information related to an identified or identifiable natural person that is subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") or other applicable Data Protection Laws. Lower case terms used but not defined in these GDPR Terms such as "personal data," "personal data breach," "processing," "controller," "processor," "subprocessor" and "data subject" will have the same meaning as set forth in Article 4 of the GDPR or other applicable Data Protection Laws. These GDPR Terms do not apply where PlayFab is a controller of the personal data of its customers.

4.1. Compliance with the GDPR and other applicable Data Protection Laws for Processing of Personal Data. You and PlayFab agree to comply with all applicable provisions of the GDPR and other applicable Data Protection Laws. You agree you are the controller of personal data and PlayFab is the processor of such personal data, except when you act as a processor of personal data, in which case PlayFab is a subprocessor. PlayFab will process personal data only on your documented instructions. You agree that these Terms of Service, any other written Service Agreement with PlayFab, and your use and configuration of features in the PlayFab Services are your complete and final documented instructions to PlayFab for the processing of personal data. In any instance where the GDPR or other applicable Data Protection Laws applies and you are a processor, you warrant to PlayFab that your instructions, including appointment of PlayFab as a processor or subprocessor, have been authorized by the relevant controller.

4.2. Processing Details. You and PlayFab acknowledge and agree that:

a) the nature and purpose of the processing is to provide the PlayFab Service pursuant to these documented instructions;
b) the subject matter of the processing is limited to personal data within the scope of the GDPR or other applicable Data Protection Laws;
c) the duration of the processing shall be for the duration of your right to use the PlayFab Service and until all personal data is deleted, or returned in accordance with your instructions;
d) the types of personal data processed by the PlayFab Service include those expressly identified in Article 4 of the GDPR or as set out in other applicable Data Protection Laws;
e) the categories of data subjects are employees, contractors, collaborators, and End Users;
f) PlayFab will process and transfer the personal data only on these documented instructions, unless required to do so by the European Union or member state law or other applicable regulatory authority to which PlayFab is subject; in such a case, PlayFab shall inform you of that legal requirement before processing (unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest); and
g) PlayFab will ensure that its personnel engaged in the processing of personal data (i) will comply with subsection (f) herein and (ii) have committed to maintain the confidentiality of any personal data even after their engagement ends.

4.3. Data Subject Rights; Assistance with Requests. PlayFab will make the personal data of data subjects available to you and provide you the ability to fulfill data subject requests under the GDPR or other applicable Data Protection Laws, both in a manner consistent with the functionality of the PlayFab Service and PlayFab's role as a processor. PlayFab shall comply with your reasonable requests to assist with your response to such a data subject request. If PlayFab receives a request from your data subject to exercise one or more of its rights under the GDPR or other applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with a game for which PlayFab is a data processor or subprocessor, PlayFab will redirect the data subject to make its request directly to you. You will be responsible for responding to any such request, including, where necessary, by using the functionality of the PlayFab Service.

4.4. Records of Processing Activities and Reasonable Assistance.  PlayFab shall maintain all records required by GDPR or other applicable Data Protection Laws and, to the extent applicable to the processing of personal data on your behalf, make them available to you upon request. PlayFab will provide you reasonable assistance in compliance with the obligations of the GDPR or other applicable Data Protection Laws, taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to PlayFab.

4.5. Data Security. You and PlayFab will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia, as appropriate:

a) the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
b) the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;
c) the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and
d) a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.

PlayFab's security measures will be set forth in a PlayFab Security Policy. PlayFab will make that policy available to you, along with descriptions of the security controls in place for the PlayFab Services and other information you reasonably request regarding PlayFab security practices and policies. You are responsible for making an independent determination as to whether the technical and organizational measures for the PlayFab Services meets your requirements. You acknowledge and agree that (taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing personal data as well as the risks to individuals) the security practices and policies implemented and maintained by PlayFab provide a level of security appropriate to the risk with respect to your personal data. You are responsible for implementing and maintaining privacy protections and security measures for components that you provide or control.

4.6. Notice and Controls on use of Subprocessors. PlayFab may hire third parties to provide certain limited or ancillary services on its behalf. You consent to the engagement of these third parties and PlayFab Affiliates as subprocessors of personal data if such consent is required under law. PlayFab will inform you of new subprocessors it engages. You may object to new subprocessors by providing written notice to PlayFab that includes an explanation of the grounds for objection.

PlayFab is responsible for its subprocessor's compliance with PlayFab's obligations in these GDPR Terms. When engaging any subprocessor, PlayFab will ensure via a written contract that the subprocessor may access and use personal data only to deliver the services PlayFab has retained them to provide and is prohibited from using personal data for any other purpose. PlayFab will ensure that subprocessors are bound by written agreements that require them to provide at least the level of data protection required of PlayFab by these terms. A current list of subprocessors can be found at https://playfab.com/privacy-terms/

4.7. Personal Data Breach. PlayFab shall notify you without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach. Such notification will include that information a processor must provide to a controller under the GDPR or other applicable Data Protection Laws to the extent such information is reasonably available to PlayFab.

PlayFab shall make reasonable efforts to assist you in fulfilling your obligation to notify the relevant supervisory authority and data subjects of a personal data breach under A the GDPR or other applicable Data Protection Laws.

4.8. Audit. PlayFab will conduct audits of its compliance with these GDPR terms as required by the GDPR or other applicable Data Protection Laws. Each audit will be performed by qualified, independent, third party and/or internal security auditors at PlayFab's selection and expense. Each audit will result in the generation of an audit report ("PlayFab Audit Report"), which PlayFab will make available to you upon request. The PlayFab Audit Report will be PlayFab's Proprietary Information and will clearly disclose any material findings by the auditor. PlayFab will promptly remediate issues raised in any PlayFab Audit Report to the satisfaction of the auditor.

4.9. Transfer of personal data. You agree you have a legal transfer mechanism for the transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organization in accordance with Data Protection Laws. All transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organization will be subject to appropriate safeguards as described in the GDPR or other applicable Data Protection Laws and such transfers and safeguards will be documented according to such laws.

If You or PlayFab transfers personal data from the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom to a third country or an international organization not recognized by the European Commission, the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, or UK Information Commissioner’s Office, respectively as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data, the parties will be deemed to have executed Module 2 of the Standard Contractual Clauses at https://playfab.com/privacy-terms/ (the “2021 Standard Contractual Clauses”), revised as necessary per the below.

For purposes of localizing the 2021 Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers out of Switzerland and the United Kingdom:

Switzerland

The parties adopt the GDPR standard for all data transfers.

Clause 13 and Annex I(C): The competent authorities under Clause 13, and in Annex I(C), are the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner and, concurrently, the EEA member state authority identified above.

Clause 17: The parties agree that the governing jurisdiction is Ireland.

Clause 18: The parties agree that the forum is Ireland. The parties agree to interpret the Standard Contractual Clauses so that Data Subjects in Switzerland are able to sue for their rights in Switzerland in accordance with Clause 18(c).

The parties agree to interpret the Standard Contractual Clauses so that “Data Subjects”

includes information about Swiss legal entities until the revised Federal Act on Data Protection becomes operative.
United Kingdom

The parties agree that the Standard Contractual Clauses are deemed amended to the extent necessary that they operate for transfers from the United Kingdom to a Third Country and provide appropriate safeguards for transfers according to Article 46 of the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation (" UK GDPR "). Such amendments include changing references to the GDPR to the UK GDPR and changing references to EU Member States to the United Kingdom.

Clause 17: The parties agree that the governing jurisdiction is the United Kingdom.

Clause 18: The parties agree that the forum is the courts of England and Wales. The parties agree that Data Subjects may bring legal proceedings against either party in the courts of any country in the United Kingdom.

In addition, transfers from the United Kingdom shall be governed by the IDTA implemented by Microsoft. For purposes of the Agreement, the “ IDTA” means the international data transfer addendum to the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses for international data transfers issued by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office under S119A(1) of the UK Data Protection Act 2018.
